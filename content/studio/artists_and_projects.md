## Mark Mandeville and Raianne Richards

Recorded "[Hard Times & Woes](https://markmandevilleraiannerichards.bandcamp.com/album/hard-times-woes)" in 2013/2014.

Reviews:

 * [Aiding & Abetting](http://www.aidabet.com/2014/041514.html)
 * [Red Line Roots](http://www.redlineroots.com/2014/04/mark-mandeville-and-raianne-richards-hardtimes-and-woes-album-review/): "The sounds they have managed to get out of the instruments are clear and crisp. It’s something I have strived for at my own home studio and just can’t seem to get, so I am especially jealous of the sonic quality of this record."
 * [The Noise, Boston](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214062518/http://thenoise-boston.com/2015/02/top-ten-of-2014/)

## Seamus McMullan

Recorded "[Distant Roots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_llrO451-ccMiIv4YHtSv_vYpC7rvYRuuA)" in 2012.

## Natasha Darius

Beautiful voice, great lyrics, and something \*definitely\* worth listening to.
