We’ve had the great pleasure of having Bob Thurston, a terrific violinist, in the studio to lay down some tracks for Natasha. He’s not only a great musician, but a terrific all-around person, and it was a pleasure to have him here. He laid down the violin tracks for four different songs, and we’re looking into scheduling more.
