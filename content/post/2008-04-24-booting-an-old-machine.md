If you’ve ever been stuck booting an old machine with a bad CD drive, or worse yet, *no* CD drive and an old enough BIOS not to properly boot a USB drive, you’ve experienced the wallbanger I have today. (and no, PXE boot wasn’t an option)

Fortunately, it appears that there is a nice boot floppy which allows booting via network or USB, which is available at ... Direct link to the zipped floppy disk image is at [etherboot.org](http://etherboot.org/wiki/index.php).
