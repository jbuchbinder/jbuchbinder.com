My team, [Shoot the Moon Films](http://shootthemoonfilms.com), participated in the iHorror 2015 "Bye Felicia" competition, ending in November 2015. This is my critical analysis of the processes used to create "[Restitution](https://www.facebook.com/RestitutionHorror)" ([IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5160544/)).

## Planning, Change of Plans, More Planning

## Shoot Day 1 & 2: Living in the past

 * Day 2 -- blood SFX took a while

## Shoot Day 3: Far too much to do, far too little Time

 * Two time periods, many, many pages of footage.
 * Setting Natasha on fire
 * Short a number of crew members
 * Aging makeup and SFX

## Post-Production

 * Moved to AAF for Resolve-to-Premiere roundtrip
 * Compressed round trip MXF video, wrapped in Quicktime wrappers
 * Never, ever send out something for scoring or post production until you are absolutely certain that you will not be making timecode relevant changes.
