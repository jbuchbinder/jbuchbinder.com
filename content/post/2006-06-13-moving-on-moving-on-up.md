Well, after many years of living in podunk cowville, I’ve moved back into a [slightly more suburban area][1], complete with [ridiculous historic figures][2]. It’s a bit easier not having to deal with [annoying power outages][3] and other awful [inconveniences][4]. And now I don’t have to worry about my mailbox getting nailed by that plow driver who always seems to target it. Hooray for the benefits of modern civilization!
