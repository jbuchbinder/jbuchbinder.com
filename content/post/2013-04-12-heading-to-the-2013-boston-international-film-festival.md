I'm heading off to the 2013 [Boston International Film Festival][1]
opening ceremonies this evening, where the first short film which I
directed, edited, and shot is being screened/premiered. It's called
"[Heroin; A Love Story][2]", and centers around a friendship in the
midst of addiction in South Boston, and was written by my partner in
filmmaking/crime, [Brian Farmer][3].

I'm planning on posting some photos and information about the
opening night and film screening as soon as I have them available.

*I hope to focus some of my upcoming entries on cinematography and
filmmaking topics, rather than my usual fare of semi-coherent
rants about miscellaneous topics, punctuated by obscure technical
postings.*
