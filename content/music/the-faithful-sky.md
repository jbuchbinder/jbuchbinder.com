Blurb: 

The core of this trio - Hugh, Diane and Jim - has been playing together for 25-30 years, starting back in the heyday of the 80's Greenwich Village "folk revival." Jeff started coming to Hugh's concerts when he was small, and music runs in his veins. Mark, our newest member, makes the cajon sound like an entire percussion section and adds harmonies. Already, The Faithful Sky is one of the tightest acoustic folk groups in New England.
