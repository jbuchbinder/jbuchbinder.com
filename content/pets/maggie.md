Hi, my name is **Maggie**, and Iâ€™m a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. I'm the chillest
dog you'll ever meet -- and no, you can't take me home with you.

I have my [own Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ZenDogMaggie), and there are [plenty of photos of me on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/whatsyourmeme/tags/maggie).
