*I'm a semi-pro photographer, in that I don't rely on photography as my primary source of income.*

## Cameras

Here are the digital cameras that I have used over the years:

*   Casio QV 5000SX – God-awful battery life; needed an external battery pack.
*   Olympus D-320L – Used this one only for a brief time. Worked pretty well.
*   [Ritz PureDigital Disposable Camera](http://www.maushammer.com/systems/dakotadigital/DakotaDigital.html) – It’s not the best quality, but the price was excellent, and it has been very durable, lasting through a lot of abuse.
*   Samsung Digimax 200
*   [Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT (350D)](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=11154) – This was my primary camera for almost two years. Someone broke the board with a heavy lens, so the body was retired.
*   [Canon EOS 40D](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=15653) – I got this in early 2008 as an “upgrade” to the 350D. Great camera.
*   **[Canon EOS 5D mark III](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_iii) – My current primary camera.**
